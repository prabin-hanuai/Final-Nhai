To reset Ubuntu to its default settings, you'll need to take several steps to restore its default configurations and settings. However, note that **resetting Ubuntu** to the default state is not a single command but a series of steps, and it involves restoring both system settings and user configurations.

Here’s how you can go about doing this:

### **1. Resetting System Settings (Non-Destructive)**

#### **a. Reset GNOME (UI) Settings**
If you want to reset the GNOME desktop settings (e.g., theme, desktop background, etc.), you can use the following command:

```bash
dconf reset -f /
```

This will reset most of the desktop settings to default. After running this, you may need to restart your session by logging out and logging back in or simply rebooting the system:

```bash
reboot
```

#### **b. Reset System Settings (APT sources, etc.)**
If you made changes to APT repositories (e.g., PPAs) and want to reset them to default:

```bash
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*
sudo apt-get update
```

This will remove any added PPAs. You can then add the official repositories again by using:

```bash
sudo apt-add-repository universe
sudo apt-add-repository multiverse
sudo apt-get update
```

### **2. Reset User Configuration Files (Non-Destructive)**

#### **a. Reset User-Specific Settings**
If you want to reset user-specific settings (for example, your application configurations), you can remove hidden configuration files (those starting with a dot) from your home directory. These are typically where personal settings are stored.

Be cautious with this, as it will remove customizations made to applications.

To delete the hidden settings files for your user:

```bash
cd ~
rm -rf .config .local .gnome .gnome2 .gconf .gconfd .purple .cache
```

This will reset most of your user preferences. You can also reset specific application settings (like Firefox, Thunderbird, etc.) if needed.

#### **b. Reset Unity / GNOME Desktop Layout**
If you want to reset the entire GNOME desktop layout (e.g., icons, panel layout), you can use:

```bash
gnome-shell --replace &
```

This will restart the GNOME shell with default settings.

### **3. Reinstall System Packages**

If you’ve removed some packages or you’re experiencing broken dependencies, you can try reinstalling the default system packages to ensure everything is as it should be.

#### **a. Reinstalling Default Packages**
You can reinstall core packages to restore defaults:

```bash
sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop
```

This will reinstall the default Ubuntu desktop environment and should restore many of the default packages and settings.

#### **b. Fix Missing or Broken Dependencies**
Run the following command to attempt to fix broken dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -f
```

### **4. Optionally, Create a New User Account**
If you want to completely reset a user account and restore it to defaults without disturbing other settings, you can create a new user:

```bash
sudo adduser newuser
```

Then, you can delete the old user if you don’t need it anymore:

```bash
sudo deluser olduser
```

### **5. Reset Ubuntu to Factory Settings (Destructive Option)**

If you want a full reset that restores everything to the original factory state (as if you've just installed Ubuntu), you will need to reinstall Ubuntu. You can do this using a live USB and selecting the option to "Reinstall Ubuntu." 

### **6. Final Check and Reboot**

After completing the above steps, reboot your system to ensure the changes are applied:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

### **Important Notes:**
- **Backup Your Data**: Before performing any drastic changes, it’s always a good idea to back up your important files, especially if you decide to go for a complete reinstall.
- **Package Settings**: If you have installed custom software or modified system files (like `/etc` files), those changes might still remain even after resetting user settings. You can manually review configuration files in `/etc/` if needed.
